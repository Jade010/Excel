# Bike Sales Dashboard Project
## Project Overview
This project involved the creatiion of an Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize bike sales data. The primary goal was to provide clear and insightful visuals that aid in understanding the trends and patterns in bike sales based on various customer demographics and behaviors.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
- **Data Cleaning:** Started by cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. This involved removing duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
- **Data Transformation:**
  * In the 'Marital Status' column, abbreviations were replaced with full words for clarity ('M' with 'Married' and 'S' with 'Single').
  * In the 'Gender' column, abbreviations were replaced with full words for clarity ('M' for 'Male' and 'F' for 'Female').
  * The 'Income' column was modified to display values as integers in currency format, enhancing readability and consistency of financial data.

## Feature Engineering
- **Age Brackets:** Introduced a new column for age brackets by using nested IF statements to categorize customers age into different age groups.

## Data Visualization
- **Pivot Tables:** Created three pivot tables as the foundation for creating informative visuals.
- **Dashboard Creation:**
  1. **Average Income Visuals:** Displays the average income for male and female customers per bike purchase. This visual is color coded to indicate whether the customer purchased a bike ('yes') or not ('no').
  2. **Customer Age Bracket Visual:** Shows the distribution of bike purchases across different customer age brackets. Also color coded based on whether the customer purchased a bike.
  3. **Customer Commute Visual:** Analyzes customer commute distances categorized into different mileage brackets, with color coding mentioned before.

## Conclusion
This excel dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for analyzing bike sales data. Through careful data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, the dashboard highlights key patterns and trends in customer behavior and preferences, aiding in strategic decision making for bike sales.
