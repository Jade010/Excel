  * In the 'Marital Status' column, abbreviations were replaced with full words for clarity ('M' with 'Married' and 'S' with 'Single').
  * In the 'Gender' column, abbreviations were replaced with full words for clarity ('M' for 'Male' and 'F' for 'Female').
  * The 'Income' column was modified to display values as integers in currency format, enhancing readability and consistency of financial data.
- **Age Brackets:** Introduced a new column for age brackets by using nested IF statements to categorize customers age into different age groups.
- **Pivot Tables:** Created three pivot tables as the foundation for creating visuals.
