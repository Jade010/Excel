# Coffee Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my comprehensive data analysis and visualization skills, focusing on a coffee sales dashboard created in Excel. It highlights my ability to manage and analyze large datasets, employ advanced Excel functions, and develop insightful visualizations. 

## Key Features
- **Data Integration:** I retrieved data from two other datasets to create a merged dataset for my visuals. I retrieved data from the customer and product datasets using XLOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH functions.
- **Data Transformation:** I utilized nested IF statements for clearer labeling and standardized formats for dates, coffee sizes, and currency for clarity and analysis.
- **Visualization:** A comprehensive dashboard was created which includes interactive elements such as a timeline, slicers, and filters.
